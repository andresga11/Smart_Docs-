# Smart_Docs
Develop a web-based Document Management System tailored for food safety and compliance, enabling users to upload, manage, and track documents with features like version control, approval workflows, and audit trails.

A web-based module designed to manage food safety and compliance documents. It enables uploading, versioning, approval, and tracking of SOPs, audit logs, certificates, and other regulatory documents. The system will support role-based access, searchable document libraries, and audit-ready logs.

# Project Objectives:

Facilitate easy document retrieval and audit readiness.


# Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS <br>
Backend: Node.js, Express.js <br>
Database: MongoDB <br>
File Storage: AWS S3 (or local for dev) <br>
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) <br>

# Scope:
User authentication and role-based access control.

Document upload, categorization, and storage.

Version control and document history tracking.

Approval workflows with digital signatures.

Audit trail logging user activities.
